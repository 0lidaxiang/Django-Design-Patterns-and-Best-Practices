第五章 模板
***********
  
本章，我们会讨论以下议题：  

    1. Django模板语法的特性
    2. 组织模板
    3. Bootstrap
    4. 模板继承树模式
    5. 活动连接模式

## 理解Django的模板语言特点
是时候谈谈MTV模板三件套中的第三个东西了。而你的团队或许有关心模板设计的设计者。或者你想要自己设计模板。无论选择哪种方式，你都需要对它们非常熟悉。毕竟，模板是直接面向用户的。  

我们对Django模板语言特性进行快速入门。  

## 变量
每个模板都获取一组上下文变量。类似于Python的字符串`format()`方法的单大括号`{variable}`语法，Django使用双大括号`{{ variable }}`语法。我们来看看它们之间的比较：  


    • 在纯净的Python中语法为`<h1>{title}</h1>`。例如：  
```python
    >>> "<h1>{title}</h1>".format(title="SuperBook") '<h1>SuperBook</h1>'
```
    • Django模板中的相等的语法是 `<h1>{{ title }}</h1>`.

    • 如下传递下相同的上下文产生同样的结果：  
```python
       >>> from django.template import Template, Context
       >>> Template("<h1>{{ title }}</h1>").render(Context({"title":
       "SuperBook"}))
       '<h1>SuperBook</h1>'
```

## 属性
点号在Django模板中是多用途的运算符。这里有三种不同类型的运算符，属性查找，字典查找，列表索引查找（依照顺序）。  

    • Python中我们首先，定义上下文变量和类：  
```python
       >>> class DrOct:
               arms = 4
               def speak(self):
                   return "You have a train to catch."
       >>> mydict = {"key":"value"}
       >>> mylist = [10, 20, 30]
```

        我们来看看三种查询类型的Python语法：  
```python        
       >>> "Dr. Oct has {0} arms and says: {1}".format(DrOct().arms,
       DrOct().speak())
       'Dr. Oct has 4 arms and says: You have a train to catch.'
       >>> mydict["key"]
        'value'
       >>> mylist[1]
        20
```
    • Django的模板等于下面:
```python
       Dr. Oct has {{ s.arms }} arms and says: {{ s.speak }}
       {{ mydict.key }}
       {{ mylist.1 }}
```

>##### 注释
注意*speak*方法没有接受参数，除了被当作属性的*self*之外。  

## 过滤器
某些时候，变量是需要修改的。从根本上来说，你要利用这些变量去调用函数。Django使用类似于Unix过滤器的管道语法`{{ var|method1|method2:"tag" }}`，而不是`var.method().method2(arg)`这样的链式函数调用。  

Another limitation is that filters cannot access the template context. It only works with the data passed into it and its arguments. Hence, it is primarily used to alter the variables in the template context.  

过滤器的另外一个限制是它不能够访问模板上下文。过滤器仅在数据传递到过滤器，以及过滤器的参数时才有效。因此，在模板上下文中它主要用来更改变量。  


    • 在Python中运行以下命令:  
```python
>>> title="SuperBook"
>>> title.upper()[:5]
'SUPER'
```

    • 其对应的Django模板为:
```python
{{ title|upper|slice:':5' }}
```

## 标签
Programming languages can do more than just display variables. Django's template language has many familiar syntactic forms, such as if and for. They should be written in the tag syntax such as {% if %}. Several template-specific forms, such
as include and block are also written in the tag syntax.  

编程语言能够做的事情不仅仅是显示变量。Django的模板语言多中相似的语法形式，比如`if`和`for`。它们应该用`{% if %}`这样的语法写成。多个针对模板的形式，比如`include`和`block`也都是用标签语法写成的。  

    • 在Python中运行以下命令:  
```python
       >>> if 1==1:
       ...     print(" Date is {0} ".format(time.strftime("%d-%m-%Y")))
        Date is 31-08-2014
```

    • 其对应的Django模板形式如下:  
```python
       {% if 1 == 1 %} Date is {% now 'd-m-Y' %} {% endif %}
```

## 哲学，不要去发明一种编程语言
A common question among beginners is how to perform numeric computations such as finding percentages in templates. As a design philosophy, the template system does not intentionally allow the following:  

新手们间的常见问题是如何执行发现模板中百分比这样的数字计算。从设计哲学的角度来说，模板系统无意支持这样做：  

    • Assignment to variables  
    • Advanced logic 
    
- 对变量赋值    
- 高级逻辑  

This decision was made to prevent you from adding business logic in templates. From our experience with PHP or ASP-like languages, mixing logic with presentation can be a maintenance nightmare. However, you can write custom template tags (which will be covered shortly) to perform any computation, especially if it is presentation-related.  
该决定能够阻止你在模板中添加业务逻辑。根据使用PHP或者类ASP语言的经历，将逻辑和表现层混合到一起是一场后期维护的噩梦。不过，你可以编写自定义的模板标签（很快就会学到）以执行任何计算，特别是和表现层相关的计算。  

>##### 提示
>Best Practice  
>Keep business logic out of your templates.  

>*最佳实践*
>保证业务逻辑远离模板。  

## Organizing templates  组织模板
The default project layout created by the startproject command does not define a location for your templates. This is very easy to fix. Create a directory named templates in your project's root directory. Add the TEMPLATE_DIRS variable in your settings.py:  

由startproject命令创建的默认项目布局并没有定义好的模板的位置。这个问题解决起来也非常简单。在项目的根目录中创建一个名称为`templates`的目录。然后在`settings.py`目录中添加`TEMPLATE_DIRS`变量。

>译者注
>在Django 1.8之后的版本中，已经不用手动定义模板路径。startproject命令创建的默认配置文件已经自动包含了项目根目录下的templates目录。  
>```python
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],
        'APP_DIRS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            'context_processors': [
                'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                'django.template.context_processors.request',
                'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
            ],
        },
    },
]
```

```python
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__))
TEMPLATE_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')]
```
```

That's all. For example, you can add a template called about.html in the urls.py file as follows: 

要定义的就这么多。例如，你可以添加一个称做`about.html`的模板，然后在`urls.py`文件中引用它：  

```python
urlpatterns = patterns('',url(r'^about/$', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='about.html'),name='about'),
```

Your templates can also reside within your apps. Creating a templates directory inside your app directory is ideal to store your app-specific templates.  

模板也可以定义在应用中。在应用的目录中创建模板目录对存储应用专用的模板来说是非常理想的。  

Here are some good practices to organize your templates:  

下面是组织模板的一些最佳实践：  

    • Keep all app-specific templates inside the app's template directory within a separate directory, for example, projroot/app/templates/app/template. html—notice how app appears twice in the path
- 再一个单独的目录中，保证所有app专用的模板都放在这个app的模板目录汇总，例如，`projroot/app/templates/app/template`。

    • Use the .html extension for your templates  
- 对模板使用.html这样对扩展名  

    • Prefix an underscore for templates, which are snippets to be included,
    for example, `_navbar.html`    
- 对模板添加一个下划线前缀，表示将要继承使用对代码片段，例如，`_navbar.html`。  
    
－ 将应用专用的模板放到一个独立的应用的模板目录中，例如，`projecroot/app/templates/app/template`, 而`html`也能够理解`app`两次出现在路径的原因。  
- 为模板使用`.html`格式的文件扩展名。  
- 对模板使用带下划线的前缀，该模板是能够在继承中使用的代码片段，例如，`_navbar.html`。  

## Support for other template languages 
## 对其他模板语言的支持 
From Django 1.8 onward, multiple template engines will be supported. There will be built-in support for the Django template language (the standard template language discussed earlier) and Jinja2. In many benchmarks, Jinja2 is quite faster than Django templates.  

从Django1.8起多模板引擎将得到支持。届时会存在内建的Django模板语言（我们之前谈到的普通模板语言）和Jinja2的支持。在很多的性能基准测试中，Jinja2比Django模板快了很多。  

It is expected that there will be an additional TEMPLATES setting for specifying the template engine and all template-related settings. The TEMPLATE_DIRS setting will be soon deprecated.  

对于指定的模板引擎和所有模板相关的设置来说都需要存在额外的TEMPLATES设置。而TEMPLATE_DIRS设置很快也会被移除。  

### Madame O
### O女士
For the first time in weeks, Steve's office corner was bustling with frenetic activity. With more recruits, the now five-member team comprised of Brad, Evan, Jacob, Sue, and Steve. Like a superhero team, their abilities were deep and amazingly well-balanced.  

Brad and Evan were the coding gurus. While Evan was obsessed over details, Brad was the big-picture guy. Jacob's talent in finding corner cases made him perfect for testing. Sue was in charge of marketing and design.  

In fact, the entire design was supposed to be done by an avant-garde design agency. It took them a month to produce an abstract, vivid, color-splashed concept loved by the management. It took them another two weeks to produce an HTML-ready version from their Photoshop mockups. However, it was eventually discarded as it proved to be sluggish and awkward on mobile devices.  

Disappointed by the failure of what was now widely dubbed as the "unicorn vomit" design, Steve felt stuck. Hart had phoned him quite concerned about the lack of any visible progress to show management. In a grim tone, he reminded Steve, "We have already eaten up the project's buffer time. We cannot afford any last-minute surprises."  

It was then that Sue, who had been unusually quiet since she joined, mentioned that she had been working on a mockup using Twitter's Bootstrap. Sue was the growth hacker in the team—a keen coder and a creative marketer.  

She admitted having just rudimentary HTML skills. However, her mockup was surprisingly thorough and looked familiar to users of other contemporary social networks. Most importantly, it was responsive and worked perfectly on every device from tablets to mobiles.  

The management unanimously agreed on Sue's design, except for someone named Madame O. One Friday afternoon, she stormed into Sue's cabin and began questioning everything from the background color to the size of the mouse cursor. Sue tried to explain to her with surprising poise and calm.  

An hour later, when Steve decided to intervene, Madame O was arguing why the profile pictures must be in a circle rather than square. "But a site-wide change like that will never get over in time," he said. Madame O shifted her gaze to him and gave him a sly smile. Suddenly, Steve felt a wave of happiness and hope surge within him. It felt immensely reliving and stimulating. He heard himself happily agreeing to all she wanted.  

Later, Steve learnt that Madame Optimism was a minor mentalist who could influence prone minds. His team loved to bring up the latter fact on the slightest occasion.  

## 使用Bootstrap
Hardly anyone starts an entire website from scratch these days. CSS frameworks such as Twitter's Bootstrap or Zurb's Foundation are easy starting points with grid systems, great typography, and preset styles. Most of them use responsive web design, making your site mobile friendly.  

图片：略  

We will be using Bootstrap, but the steps will be similar for other CSS frameworks. There are three ways to include Bootstrap in your website:  

我们将使用Bootstrap，而且步骤也类似于其他的CSS框架。在网站中使用Bootstrap有三种方法：  

- Find a project skeleton: If you have not yet started your project, then finding a project skeleton that already has Bootstrap is a great option. A project skeleton such as edge (created by yours truly) can be used as the initial structure while running startproject as follows:  

- 寻找项目架构：如果还没有启动项目，那么查找项目架构

```python
$ django-admin.py startproject --template=https://github.com/arocks/edge/archive/master.zip --extension=py,md,html myproj
```
    Alternatively, you can use one of the cookiecutter templates with support for Bootstrap.  

可选择的是，你可以使用其中一个拥有Bootstrap支持的cookiecutter模板。  

- Use a package: The easiest option if you have already started your project is to use a package, such as django-frontend-skeleton or django-bootstrap-toolkit.  
- 使用包：最简单的选项是如果你已经开始对自己的项目使用包，比如django-frontend-skeleton 或者 django-bootstrap-toolkit。  

-  Manually copy: None of the preceding options guarantees that their version of Bootstrap is the latest one. Bootstrap releases are so frequent that package authors have a hard time keeping their files up to date. So, if you would like to work with the latest version of Bootstrap, the best option is to download it from http://getbootstrap.com yourself. Be sure to read the release notes to check whether your templates need to be changed due to backward incompatibility.  
-  手动复制：

Copy the dist directory that contains the css, js, and fonts directories into your project root under the static directory. Ensure that this path is set for STATICFILES_DIRS in your settings.py:  

复制包含css、js的dist目录，以及静态目录下根目录中的字体目录。保证这个路径设置在settings.py中的STATICFILES_DIRS：  

```python
       STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static")]
    Now you can include the Bootstrap assets in your templates, as follows:
       {% load staticfiles %}
         <head>
           <link href="{% static 'css/bootstrap.min.css' %}"
       rel="stylesheet">
```

## But they all look the same! 
## 怎么它们看上去都一个模样啊！
Bootstrap might be a great way to get started quickly. However, sometimes, developers get lazy and do not bother to change the default look. This leaves a poor impression on your users who might find your site's appearance a little too familiar and uninteresting.  

Bootstrap或许是快速开发的非常好的选择。不过，有时候，开发者懒得去改变默认的外观。这就留给了浏览网站的用户一个糟糕的映像。

Bootstrap comes with plenty of options to improve its visual appeal. There is a file called `variables.less` that contains several variables from the primary brand color to the default font, as follows:  

Bootstrap带来了很多的改进外观需求的选项。

```html
    @brand-primary: #428bca;
    @brand-success: #5cb85c;
    @brand-info: #5bc0de;
    @brand-warning: #f0ad4e;
    @brand-danger: #d9534f;
    @font-family-sans-serif:  "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-
    serif;
    @font-family-serif:
    @font-family-monospace:
    monospace;
    @font-family-base:
    Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
    Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, "Courier New",
    @font-family-sans-serif;  
```

Bootstrap documentation explains how you can set up the build system (including the LESS compiler) to compile these files down to the style sheets. Or quite conveniently, you can visit the 'Customize' area of the Bootstrap site to generate your customized style sheet online.  

Thanks to the huge community around Bootstrap, there are also several sites, such as bootswatch.com, which have themed style sheets, that are drop-in replacements for your bootstrap.min.css.  

Another approach is to override the Bootstrap styles. This is recommended if you find upgrading your customized Bootstrap style sheet between Bootstrap versions to be quite tedious. In this approach, you can add your site-wide styles in a separate CSS (or LESS) file and include it after the standard Bootstrap style sheet. Thus, you can simply upgrade the Bootstrap file with minimal changes to your site-wide style sheet.  

另外一个方法是重写Bootstrap版式。  

Last but not the least, you can make your CSS classes more meaningful by replacing structural names, such as 'row' or 'column-md-4', with 'wrapper' or 'sidebar'. You can do this with a few lines of LESS code, as follows:  

```html
   .wrapper {
     .make-row();
    }
    .sidebar {
     .make-md-column(4);
   }
```

This is possible due to a feature called mixins (sounds familiar?). With the Less source files, Bootstrap can be completely customized to your needs.  

## 模板模式
Django's template language is quite simple. However, you can save a lot of time by following some elegant template design patterns. Let's take a look at some of them.  

Django模板语言非常的简单。然而，它通过一些简洁的模板设计模式可以让你节省很多的时间。让我们来看看其中的一些模板设计模式。  
  
## 模式-模板继承树
Problem: Templates have lots of repeated content in several pages.  

问题：在多个页面中模板存在很多重复的内容。  

Solution: Use template inheritance wherever possible and include snippets elsewhere.  

解决方案： 只要是有可能的地方就使用模板继承，并在其他地方继承代码片段。  

## 问题细节
Users expect pages of a website to follow a consistent structure. Certain interface elements, such as navigation menu, headers, and footers are seen in most web applications. However, it is cumbersome to repeat them in every template.  

用户期望网站的页面能够遵循结构的一致性。某些接口元素，比如在很多web应用都能够见到的导航栏菜单，首部，和页脚。不过，在每一个模板中都重复它们显示相当笨重。  

Most templating languages have an include mechanism. The contents of another file, possibly a template, can be included at the position where it is invoked. This can get tedious in a large project.  

大多数的模板语言都拥有模板继承机制。其他文件的内容，也可以是一个模板都能够在它们被调用的地方导入。在大型项目中这样做会让你感到乏味的。  

The sequence of the snippets to be included in every template would be mostly the same. The ordering is important and hard to check for mistakes. Ideally, we should be able to create a 'base' structure. New pages ought to extend this base to specify only the changes or make extensions to the base content.  

在每一个模板中将要继承的代码片段序列很大程度上是相同的。倒入顺序很重要，而错误检查却很难。理论上，我们能够创建一个`基础`结构。新的页面应当扩展这个基础模板

## 方案详情
Django templates have a powerful extension mechanism. Similar to classes in programming, a template can be extended through inheritance. However, for that to work, the base itself must be structured into blocks as follows:  

Django模板拥有一个强大的扩展机制。类似于编程中的类，模板可以通过继承来扩展。不过，

图片：略  

The base.html template is, by convention, the base structure for the entire site. This template will usually be well-formed HTML (that is, with a preamble and matching closing tags) that has several placeholders marked with the {% block tags %} tag. For example, a minimal base.html file looks like the following:  

我们约定，base.html 模板是真个网站的基本结构。这个模板

```html
    <html>
    <body>
    <h1>{% block heading %}Untitled{% endblock %}</h1>
    {% block content %}
    {% endblock %}
    </body>
    </html>
```

There are two blocks here, heading and content, that can be overridden. You can extend the base to create specific pages that can override these blocks. For example, here is an about page:  

这里存在两个能够被重写块，heading和content。你可以扩展基础模板以创建能够重写这些块的特有页面。例如，这里是一个about页面：  

```html
    {% extends "base.html" %}
    {% block content %}
    <p> This is a simple About page </p>
    {% endblock %}
    {% block heading %}About{% endblock %}
```

Notice that we do not have to repeat the structure. We can also mention the blocks in any order. The rendered result will have the right blocks in the right places as defined in base.html.  

If the inheriting template does not override a block, then its parent's contents are used. In the preceding example, if the about template does not have a heading, then it will have the default heading of 'Untitled'.  

The inheriting template can be further inherited forming an inheritance chain. This pattern can be used to create a common derived base for pages with a certain layout, for example, single-column layout. A common base template can also be created for a section of the site, for example, blog pages.  

Usually, all inheritance chains can be traced back to a common root, base.html; hence, the pattern's name—Template inheritance tree. Of course, this need not be strictly followed. The error pages 404.html and 500.html are usually not inherited and stripped bare of most tags to prevent further errors.   

## 模式-活动链接
Problem: The navigation bar is a common component in most pages. However, the active link needs to reflect the current page the user is on.  

问题：在很多对页面中导航栏是一个常见对组件。然而，活动链接需要在用户登陆时进行响应的映射。  

Solution: Conditionally, change the active link markup by setting context variables or based on the request path.  

解决方案：根据条件不同，通过设置上下文变量或者请求路径来改变活动链接的外观。  

### 问题细节
The naïve way to implement the active link in a navigation bar is to manually set it in every page. However, this is neither DRY nor foolproof.  

在导航栏内实现活动链接的简单办法是手动地在每个一个需要实现该功能的页面中设置。不过，这样过既不符合DRY原则，也并不能保证万无一失。  

### 方案详情
There are several solutions to determine the active link. Excluding JavaScript-based approaches, they can be mainly grouped into template-only and custom
tag-based solutions.  

确定活动链接的解决方法有多种。包括，基于Javascript的方法，它们主要是将纯模板和自定义标签组合到一起。  

### 临时模板方案
By mentioning an active_link variable while including the snippet of the navigation template, this solution is both simple and easy to implement.  



In every template, you will need to include the following line (or inherit it):  

在每一个模板中，你都需要包括以下内容（或者继承它）：


```python  
    {% include "_navbar.html" with active_link='link2' %}
```


The _navbar.html file contains the navigation menu with a set of checks for the
active link variable:  


```python
    {# _navbar.html #}
   <ul class="nav nav-pills">
     <li{% if active_link == "link1" %} class="active"{% endif %}><a
   href="{% url 'link1' %}">Link 1</a></li>
     <li{% if active_link == "link2" %} class="active"{% endif %}><a
   href="{% url 'link2' %}">Link 2</a></li>
     <li{% if active_link == "link3" %} class="active"{% endif %}><a
   href="{% url 'link3' %}">Link 3</a></li>
   </ul>
```

##自定义标签
Django templates offer a versatile set of built-in tags. It is quite easy to create your own custom tag. Since custom tags live inside an app, create a templatetags directory inside an app. This directory must be a package, so it should have an (empty) __init__.py file.  

Next, write your custom template in an appropriately named Python file. For example, for this active link pattern, we can create a file called nav.py with the following contents:  

    # app/templatetags/nav.py
    from django.core.urlresolvers import resolve
    from django.template import Library
    register = Library()
    @register.simple_tag
    def active_nav(request, url):
       url_name = resolve(request.path).url_name
       if url_name == url:
           return "active"
       return ""

This file defines a custom tag named active_nav. It retrieves the URL's path component from the request argument (say, /about/—see Chapter 4, Views and URLs, for a detailed explanation of the URL path). Then, the resolve() function is used to lookup the URL pattern's name (as defined in urls.py) from the path. Finally, it returns the string "active" only when the pattern's name matches the expected pattern name.  

The syntax for calling this custom tag in a template is {% active_nav request 'pattern_name' %}. Notice that the request needs to be passed in every page this tag is used.  

Including a variable in several views can get cumbersome. Instead, we add a built-in context processor to TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS in settings.py so that the request will be present in a request variable across the site, as follows:  

```python
     # settings.py
    from django.conf import global_settings
    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = \
       global_settings.TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS + (
           'django.core.context_processors.request',
        )
```

Now, all that remains is to use this custom tag in your template to set the active attribute:  

```python
    {# base.html #}
   {% load nav %}
   <ul class="nav nav-pills">
     <li class={% active_nav request 'active1' %}><a href="{% url
   'active1' %}">Active 1</a></li>
     <li class={% active_nav request 'active2' %}><a href="{% url
   'active2' %}">Active 2</a></li>
     <li class={% active_nav request 'active3' %}><a href="{% url
   'active3' %}">Active 3</a></li>
   </ul>
```

##总结
In this chapter, we looked at the features of Django's template language. Since it
is easy to change the templating language in Django, many people might consider replacing it. However, it is important to learn the design philosophy of the built-in template language before we seek alternatives.  

在这一章，我们浏览了Django的模板特性。因为在Django中切换模板语言很简单，所以很多人都考虑替换。不过，在浏览其他的选择之前重要的是学些内建模板语言的设计哲学。  

In the next chapter, we will look into one of the killer features of Django, that is, the admin interface, and how we can customize it.  

下一章，我们会学习Django的杀手级功能，即，admin接口，以及我们如何定制它。
