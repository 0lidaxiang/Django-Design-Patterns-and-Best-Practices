第七章-表单
***********

这一章我们会讨论一下话题：  

    • 表单的工作流程
    • 不可信的输入
    • 表单处理类视图
    • 表单与CRUD视图


我们把Django表单放到一边，来讨论下常规情况下的表单是个什么样子。表单不仅长，而且有着多个需要填充的无趣的页面。可以说表单无所不在。我们每天都用到它。表单支撑了谷歌搜索框到脸书的点赞按钮这所有的一切。  

Django把使用表单时产生的验证和描述这类的大量繁重工作给抽象了。它也实现了多种的安全问题的最佳实践。可是，表单在处理自身多个状态之一时也是令人困惑的起因。  

## 表单的工作原理
表单理解起来比较困难，因为它同不止一个请求-响应循环交互。最简单的场景是，你需要展示一个空表单，然后用户来正确地填充和提交表单。另外一种情况是它们输入一些无效的数据，表单需要重复的提交知道整个表单有效为止。  

因此，表单表现出多种状态：  

```
    • **空表单：**在Django中此表单称为未绑定表单
    • **已填充表单：**Django中该表单称为已绑定表单
    • **有错误的已提交表单：**该表单称做已绑定表单，但不是有效表单
    • **没有错误的已提交表单：**该表单称做已绑定且有效的表单
```
  
注意用户永远不会见到表单的最后状态。他们不必如此。提交的有效表单应当把用户带到表单提交成功之后的页面。  

## Django中的表单
通过总结它们到一个层次，Django的`form`类每个字段的状态，以及表单自身。表单拥有两个重要的状态属性，一如下面所示：  

```
    • *is_bound*: 如果返回值为假，则它是一个未绑定的表单，即，新的空表单，或者默认的字段值。如果返回值为真，表单被绑定，即，至少有一个用户设置的字段。

    • *is_valid()*: 如果返回真，已绑定表单中的所有字段都拥有有效的数据。如果返回假，至少有一个字段中存在一部分无效数据，或者表单未被绑定。
```

举例来说，想象一下你需要一个接受用户名字和年龄的简单表单。这个类可以这样来定义：  

```python
# forms.py
   from django import forms
   class PersonDetailsForm(forms.Form):
       name = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
       age = forms.IntegerField()
```
  
该类可以以绑定或者不绑定方式来初始化，一如下面代码所示：  

```python
>>> f = PersonDetailsForm()
>>> print(f.as_p())
<p><label for="id_name">Name:</label> <input id="id_name" maxlength="100"
name="name" type="text" /></p>
<p><label for="id_age">Age:</label> <input id="id_age" name="age"
type="number" /></p>
>>> f.is_bound
False
>>> g = PersonDetailsForm({"name": "Blitz", "age": "30"})
>>> print(g.as_p())
<p><label for="id_name">Name:</label> <input id="id_name" maxlength="100"
name="name" type="text" value="Blitz" /></p>
<p><label for="id_age">Age:</label> <input id="id_age" name="age"
type="number" value="30" /></p>
>>> g.is_bound
 True
```
  
要注意HTML是如何表现改变以包括它们中已绑定数据的值属性。  

表单可以只在你创建表单对象时才被绑定，即，在构造器中。用户如何在类字典对象的最后面输入每个表单字段的值？  

要想解决这个问题，你需要理解用户是如何与表单交互的。在下面的的图表中，用户打开用户账户表单，首先是正确地填充，并提交它，然后用有效信息重新提交表单：  



如前面的表单所示，当用户提交表单时，在`request.POST`（它是一个`QueryDict`的实例）内部所有可调用的视图获取到全部的表单数据。表单使用类字典对象——以这种方式引用是因为它的行为类似于字典，来初始，并拥有一点额外的功能。  

表单可以通过两种不同的方式来定义以发送数据表单：`GET`或者`POST`。表单使用`METHOD=“GET”`定义以发送以URL编码的表单数据，例如，当你提交谷歌搜索时，URL取得表单输入，即，搜索字符串显式地嵌入，比如`?q=Cat+Pictures`就是如此。`GET`方法用来幂等表单，它不会对世界状态做出任何的最新改变。（不要太过于迂腐，多次处理有同样的效果就像一次处理）。大多数情况下，这意味着它只在重新取回数据时被用到。  

不过，不计其数的表单都是使用`METHOD=“POST”`来定义的。这样，表单数据会一直发送HTTP请求的主体部分，而且它们对于用户来说是不可见的。它们被用于任何涉及到边际效应的事情，比如存储或者更新数据。  

视你所定义表单类型的不同，当用户提交表单时，视图会重新取回`request.GET`或者`request.POST`中的表单数据。如同早前咱么提到的那样，它们中的哪一个都类似于字典。因此，你可以传递它到表单类构造器以获取绑定的`form`对象。  


>####The Breach
Steve was curled up and snoring heavily in his large three-seater couch. For the last few weeks, he had been spending more than 12 hours at the office, and tonight was no exception. His phone lying on the carpet beeped. 􏰅t first, he said so􏰀ething incoherently, still deep in sleep. Then, it beeped again and again, in increasing urgency.  

>By the fifth beep, 􏰆teve awoke with a start. He frantically searched all over his couch, and finally located his phone. The screen showed a brightly colored bar chart. Every bar seemed to touch the high line except one. He pulled out his laptop and logged into the SuperBook server. The site was up and none of the logs indicated any unusual activity. However, the external services didn't look that good.  

>The phone at the other end seemed to ring for eternity until a croaky voice answered, 􏰇Hello, 􏰆teve?􏰇 Half an hour later, 􏰈acob was able to 􏰄ero down the proble􏰀 to an unresponsive superhero verification service. 􏰇Isn't that running on 􏰆auron?􏰇 asked 􏰆teve. There was a brief hesitation. "I am afraid so," replied Jacob.  

>Steve had a sinking feeling at the pit of his stomach. Sauron, a 􏰀ainfra􏰀e application, was their first line of defense against cyber-attacks and other kinds of possible attack. It was three in the morning when he alerted the mission control team. Jacob kept chatting with him the whole time. He was running every available diagnostic tool. There was no sign of any security breach.  

>Steve tried to calm him down. He reassured him that perhaps it was a temporary overload and he should get some rest. However, he knew that Jacob wouldn't stop until he found what's wrong. He also knew that it was not typical of Sauron to have a temporary overload. Feeling extremely exhausted, he slipped back to sleep.  

>Next 􏰀morning, as 􏰆steve hurried to his office building holding a bagel, he heard a deafening roar. He turned and looked up to see a massive spaceship looming towards him. Instinctively, he ducked behind a hedge. On the other side, he could hear several heavy metallic objects clanging onto the ground. Just then his cell phone rang. It was Jacob. Something had moved closer to him. As Steve looked up, he saw a nearly 10-foot-tall robot, colored orange and black, pointing what looked like a weapon directly down at him.  

>His phone was still ringing. He darted out into the open barely missing the sputtering shower of bullets around him. He took the call. "Hey Steve, guess what, I found out what actually happened." "I am dying to know," Steve quipped.  

>"Remember, we had used UserHoller's form widget to collect customer feedback? 􏰅pparently, their data was not that clean. I 􏰀ean several serious exploits. Hey, there is a lot of background noise. Is that the T􏰊?􏰇 Steve dived towards a large sign that said "Safe Assembly Point". "Just ignore that. Tell me what happened," he screamed.  

>"Okay. So, when our admin opened their feedback page, his laptop must have gotten infected. The worm could reach other systems he has access to, specifically, 􏰆auron. I 􏰀ust say 􏰈acob, this is a very targeted attack. Someone who knows our security system quite well has designed this. I have a feeling something scary is coming our way."  

>Across the lawn, a robot picked up an SUV and hurled it towards Steve. He raised his hands and shut his eyes. The spinning mass of metal froze a few feet above hi􏰀. 􏰇I􏰀portant call?􏰇 asked Hexa as she dropped the car. 􏰇Yeah, please get 􏰀e out of here,􏰇 􏰆teve begged.  

##Why does data need cleaning?
Eventually, you need to get the "cleaned data" from the form. Does this mean that the values that the user had entered were not clean? Yes, for two reasons.  
First, anything that comes from the outside world should not be trusted initially. Malicious users can enter all sorts of exploits through a form that can undermine the security of your site. So, any form data must be sanitized before you use them.  

####Best Practice
Never trust the user input.  

􏰆econdly, the field values in request.POST or request.GET are just strings. Even if your for􏰀 field can be defined as an integer 􏰋say, age􏰌 or date 􏰋say, birthday􏰌, the browser would send them as strings to your view. Invariably, you would like to convert them to the appropriate Python types before use. The form class does this conversion automatically for you while cleaning.  

Let's see this in action:  
```python
    >>> fill = {"name": "Blitz", "age": "30"}
    >>> g = PersonDetailsForm(fill)
    >>> g.is_valid()
        True
    >>> g.cleaned_data
        {'age': 30, 'name': 'Blitz'}
    >>> type(g.cleaned_data["age"])
        int
```
  
The age value was passed as a string (possibly, from request.POST) to the form class. After validation, the cleaned data contains the age in the integer form. This is exactly what you would expect. Forms try to abstract away the fact that strings are passed around and give you clean Python objects that you can use.  

##Displaying forms
Django forms also help you create an HTML representation of your form. They support three different representations: as_p (as paragraph tags), as_ul (as unordered list items), and as_table (as, unsurprisingly, a table).  

The template code, generated HTML code, and browser rendering for each of these representations have been summarized in the following table:  

表格：略  

􏰉otice that the HTML representation gives only the for􏰀 fields. This 􏰀akes it easier to include multiple Django forms in a single HTML form. However, this also means that the template designer has a fair bit of boilerplate to write for each form, as shown in the following code:  

```python
<form method="post">
     {% csrf_token %}
     <table>{{ form.as_table }}</table>
     <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```
  
>Note that to make the HTML representation complete, you need to add the surrounding form tags, a CSRF token, the table or ul tags, and the submit button.  

##Time to be crisp
It can get tiresome to write so much boilerplate for each form in your templates. The django-crispy-forms package makes writing the form template code more crisp (in the sense of short). It moves all the presentation and layout into the Django form itself. This way, you can write more Python code and less HTML.  

The following table shows that the crispy form template tag generates a more complete form, and the appearance is much more native to the Bootstrap style:  

表格：略  

􏰆o, how do you get crisper for􏰀s? You will need to install the django-crispy- forms package and add it to your INSTALLED_APPS. If you use Bootstrap 3, then you will need to mention this in your settings:  

```python
CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = "bootstrap3"
```
  
The form initialization will need to mention a helper attribute of the type FormHelper. The following code is intended to be minimal and uses the default layout:  

```python
from crispy_forms.helper import FormHelper
   from crispy_forms.layout import Submit
   class PersonDetailsForm(forms.Form):
       name = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
       age = forms.IntegerField()
       def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
           super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
           self.helper = FormHelper(self)
           self.helper.layout.append(Submit('submit', 'Submit'))
```
  
##Understanding CSRF
So, you must have noticed something called a CSRF token in the form templates. What does it do? It is a security 􏰀echanis􏰀 against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks for your forms.  

It works by injecting a server-generated random string called a CSRF token, unique to a user's session. 􏰍very ti􏰀e a for􏰀 is sub􏰀itted, it 􏰀ust have a hidden field that contains this token. This token ensures that the form was generated for the user by the original site, rather than a fake for􏰀 created by an attacker with si􏰀ilar fields.  

CSRF tokens are not recommended for forms using the GET method because the GET actions should not change the server state. Moreover, forms submitted via GET would expose the CSRF token in the URLs. Since URLs have a higher risk of being logged or shoulder-sniffed, it is better to use CSRF in forms using the POST method.  

##Form processing with Class-based views
We can essentially process a form by subclassing the Class-based view itself:  

```python
class ClassBasedFormView(generic.View):
       template_name = 'form.html'
       def get(self, request):
           form = PersonDetailsForm()
           return render(request, self.template_name, {'form': form})
       def post(self, request):
           form = PersonDetailsForm(request.POST)
           if form.is_valid():
               # Success! We can use form.cleaned_data now
               return redirect('success')
           else:
               # Invalid form! Reshow the form with error highlighted
               return render(request, self.template_name,
                             {'form': form})
```
  
Compare this code with the sequence diagram that we saw previously. The three scenarios have been separately handled.  

Every form is expected to follow the Post/Redirect/Get (PRG) pattern. If the submitted form is found to be valid, then it must issue a redirect. This prevents duplicate form submissions.  

However, this is not a very DRY code. The for􏰀 class na􏰀e and te􏰀plate na􏰀e attributes have been repeated. Using a generic class-based view such as FormView can reduce the redundancy of form processing. The following code will give you the same functionality as the previous one in fewer lines of code:  

```python
from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse_lazy
   class GenericFormView(generic.FormView):
       template_name = 'form.html'
       form_class = PersonDetailsForm
       success_url = reverse_lazy("success")
```
  
We need to use reverse_lazy in this case because the URL patterns are not loaded when the view file is i􏰀ported.  

##Form patterns
Let's take a look at some of the common patterns when working with forms.  

##Pattern - dynamic form generation
Problem: Adding for􏰀 fields dyna􏰀ically or changing for􏰀 fields fro􏰀 what has been declared.  

Solution􏰂 􏰅dd or change fields during initiali􏰄ation of the for􏰀.  

###Problem details
For􏰀s are usually defined in a declarative style with for􏰀 fields listed as class fields. However, so􏰀eti􏰀es we do not know the nu􏰀ber or type of these fields in advance. This calls for the for􏰀 to be dyna􏰀ically generated. This pattern is sometimes called Dynamic Forms or Runtime form generation.  

I􏰀agine a 􏰁ight passenger check􏰃in syste􏰀, which allows for the upgrade of econo􏰀y class tickets to first class. If there are any first􏰃class seats left, there needs to be an additional option to the user if they would like to 􏰁y first class. However, this optional field cannot be declared since it will not be shown to all users.Such dynamic forms can be handled by this pattern.  

###Solution details
Every form instance has an attribute called fields, which is a dictionary that holds all the for􏰀 fields. This can be 􏰀odified at runti􏰀e. 􏰅dding or changing the fields can be done during for􏰀 initiali􏰄ation itself.  

For example, if we need to add a checkbox to a user details form only if a keyword argument named "upgrade" is true at form initialization, then we can implement it as follows:  

```python
class PersonDetailsForm(forms.Form):
       name = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
       age = forms.IntegerField()
       def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
           upgrade = kwargs.pop("upgrade", False)
           super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
           # Show first class option?
           if upgrade:
               self.fields["first_class"] = forms.BooleanField(
                   label="Fly First Class?")

```
  
Now, we just need to pass the, PersonDetailsForm(upgrade=True) keyword argu􏰀ent to 􏰀ake an additional Boolean input field 􏰋 a checkbox􏰌 appear.  

>Note that a newly introduced keyword argument has to be removed or popped before we call super to avoid the unexpected keyword error.  

If we use a FormView class for this example, then we need to pass the keyword argument by overriding the get_form_kwargs method of the view class, as shown in the following code:  

```python
class PersonDetailsEdit(generic.FormView):
       ...
       def get_form_kwargs(self):
           kwargs = super().get_form_kwargs()
           kwargs["upgrade"] = True
           return kwargs
```
  
This pattern can be used to change any attribute of a field at runti􏰀e, such as its widget or help text. It works for model forms as well.  

In many cases, a seeming need for dynamic forms can be solved using Django formsets. They are used when a form needs to be repeated in a page. A typical use case for formsets is while designing a data grid-like view to add elements row by row. This way, you do not need to create a dynamic form with an arbitrary number of rows. You just need to create a for􏰀 for the row and create 􏰀ultiple rows using a formset_factory function.  

##􏰎􏰏Pattern - user-based forms
Problem: Forms need to be customized based on the logged-in user.  

Solution: Pass the logged-in user as a keyword argument to the form's initializer.  

###Problem details
A form can be presented in different ways based on the user. Certain users might not need to fill all the fields, while certain others 􏰀ight need to add additional information. In some cases, you might need to run some checks on the user's eligibility, such as verifying whether they are members of a group, to determine how the form should be constructed.  

###Solution details
As you must have noticed, you can solve this using the solution given in the Dyna􏰀ic for􏰀 generation pattern. You just need to pass request.user as a keyword argument to the form. However, we can also use mixins from the django-braces package for a shorter and more reusable solution.  

As in the previous example, we need to show an additional checkbox to the user. However, this will be shown only if the user is a member of the VIP group. Let's take a look at how PersonDetailsForm gets si􏰀plified with the for􏰀 􏰀ixin UserKwargModelFormMixin fromdjango-braces:  

```python
from braces.forms import UserKwargModelFormMixin
   class PersonDetailsForm(UserKwargModelFormMixin, forms.Form):
       ...
       def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
           super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
           # Are you a member of the VIP group?
           if self.user.groups.filter(name="VIP").exists():
               self.fields["first_class"] = forms.BooleanField(
                   label="Fly First Class?")
```
  
Notice how self.user was automatically made available by the mixin by popping the user keyword argument.  

Corresponding to the form mixin, there is a view mixin called UserFormKwargsMixin, which needs to be added to the view, along with LoginRequiredMixin to ensure that only logged-in users can access this view:  

```python

   class VIPCheckFormView(LoginRequiredMixin, UserFormKwargsMixin,
   generic.FormView):
      form_class = PersonDetailsForm
       ...
```
  
Now, the user argument will be passed to the PersonDetailsForm form automatically.  

Do check out other form mixins in django-braces such as FormValidMessageMixin, which are readymade solutions to common form-usage patterns.  

##Pattern - multiple form action per view
Problem: Handling multiple form actions in a single view or page.  

Solution: Forms can use separate views to handle form submissions or a single
view can identify the form based on the Submit button's name.  

###Problem details
Django makes it relatively straightforward to combine multiple forms with the same action, for example, a single submit button. However, most web pages need to show several actions on the same page. For example, you might want the user to subscribe or unsubscribe from a newsletter in two distinct forms on the same page.  

However, Django's FormView is designed to handle only one form per view scenario. Many other generic class-based views also share this assumption.  

###Solution details
There are two ways to handle multiple forms: a separate view and single view. Let's take a look at the first approach.  

###Separate views for separate actions
This is a fairly straightforward approach with each form specifying different views as their actions. For example, take the subscribe and unsubscribe forms. There can be two separate view classes to handle just the POST method from their respective forms.  

###Same view for separate actions
Perhaps you find the splitting views to handle for􏰀s to be unnecessary, or you find handling logically related for􏰀s in a co􏰀􏰀on view to be 􏰀ore elegant. 􏰍ither way, we can work around the limitations of generic class-based views to handle more than one form.  

While using the same view class for multiple forms, the challenge is to identify which form issued the POST action. Here, we take advantage of the fact that the name and value of the Submit button is also submitted. If the Submit button is na􏰀ed uniquely across for􏰀s, then the for􏰀 can be identified while processing.  

Here, we define a subscribe for􏰀 using crispy for􏰀s so that we can na􏰀e the submit button as well:  

```python

   class SubscribeForm(forms.Form):
       email = forms.EmailField()
       def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
           super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
           self.helper = FormHelper(self)
           self.helper.layout.append(Submit('subscribe_butn',
'Subscribe'))
```
  
The UnSubscribeForm unsubscribe for􏰀 class is defined in exactly the sa􏰀e way
(and hence is, omitted), except that its Submit button is named unsubscribe_butn.  

Since FormView is designed for a single form, we will use a simpler class-based view say, TemplateView, as the base for our view. Let's take a look at the view definition and the get method:  

```python
from .forms import SubscribeForm, UnSubscribeForm
   class NewsletterView(generic.TemplateView):
       subcribe_form_class = SubscribeForm
       unsubcribe_form_class = UnSubscribeForm
       template_name = "newsletter.html"
       def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
           kwargs.setdefault("subscribe_form", self.subcribe_form_
   class())
           kwargs.setdefault("unsubscribe_form", self.unsubcribe_form_
   class())
           return super().get(request, *args, **kwargs)

```
  
The keyword arguments to a TemplateView class get conveniently inserted into the template context. We create instances of either form only if they don't already exist, with the help of the setdefault dictionary method. We will soon see why.  

Next, we will take a look at the POST method, which handles submissions from either form:  

```python
def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
           form_args = {
               'data': self.request.POST,
               'files': self.request.FILES,
           }
           if "subscribe_butn" in request.POST:
               form = self.subcribe_form_class(**form_args)
               if not form.is_valid():
                   return self.get(request,
                                      subscribe_form=form)
               return redirect("success_form1")
           elif "unsubscribe_butn" in request.POST:
               form = self.unsubcribe_form_class(**form_args)
               if not form.is_valid():
                   return self.get(request,
                                      unsubscribe_form=form)
               return redirect("success_form2")
           return super().get(request)
```
  
First, the form keyword arguments, such as data and files, are populated in a form_args dictionary. 􏰉ext, the presence of the first for􏰀's Submit button is checked in request.POST. If the button's na􏰀e is found, then the first for􏰀 is instantiated.  

If the form fails validation, then the response created by the GET method with the first for􏰀's instance is returned. In the sa􏰀e way, we look for the second for􏰀s submit button to check whether the second form was submitted.  

Instances of the same form in the same view can be implemented in the same way with for􏰀 prefixes. You can instantiate a for􏰀 with a prefix argu􏰀ent such as SubscribeForm(prefix="offers"). 􏰆uch an instance will prefix all its for􏰀 fields with the given argu􏰀ent, effectively working like a for􏰀 na􏰀espace.  

##Pattern - CRUD views
Problem: Writing boilerplate for CRUD interfaces to a model is repetitive.  

Solution: Use generic class-based editing views.  

###Problem details
In most web applications, about 80 percent of the time is spent writing, creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) interfaces to a database. For instance, Twitter essentially involves creating and reading each other's tweets. Here, a tweet would be the database object that is being manipulated and stored.  

Writing such interfaces from scratch can get tedious. This pattern can be easily managed if CRUD interfaces can be automatically created from the model class itself.  

###Solution details
Django si􏰀plifies the process of creating CRUD views with a set of four generic class-based views. They can be mapped to their corresponding operations as follows:  

    • CreateView: This view displays a blank form to create a new object
    • DetailView: This view shows an object's details by reading from the
    database
    • UpdateView: This view allows to update an object's details through a pre-populated form
    • DeleteView􏰂 This view displays a confir􏰀ation page and, on approval, deletes the object
  
Let's take a look at a simple example. We have a model that contains important dates, which are of interest to everyone using our site. We need to build simple CRUD interfaces so that anyone can view and modify these dates. Let's take a look at the ImportantDate model itself:  

```python
# models.py
   class ImportantDate(models.Model):
       date = models.DateField()
       desc = models.CharField(max_length=100)
       def get_absolute_url(self):
           return reverse('impdate_detail', args=[str(self.pk)])
```
  
The get_absolute_url() method is used by the CreateView and UpdateView classes to redirect after a successful object creation or update. It has been routed to the object's DetailView.  

The CRUD views themselves are simple enough to be self-explanatory, as shown in the following code:  

```python
# views.py
   from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse_lazy
   from . import forms
   class ImpDateDetail(generic.DetailView):
       model = models.ImportantDate
   class ImpDateCreate(generic.CreateView):
       model = models.ImportantDate
       form_class = forms.ImportantDateForm
   class ImpDateUpdate(generic.UpdateView):
       model = models.ImportantDate
       form_class = forms.ImportantDateForm
   class ImpDateDelete(generic.DeleteView):
       model = models.ImportantDate
       success_url = reverse_lazy("impdate_list")
```
  
In these generic views, the model class is the only mandatory member to be mentioned. However, in the case of DeleteView, the success_url function needs to be mentioned as well. This is because after deletion get_absolute_url cannot be used any􏰀ore to find out where to redirect users.  

Defining the form_class attribute is not mandatory. If it is omitted, a ModelForm 􏰀ethod corresponding to the specified 􏰀odel will be created. However, we would like to create our own model form to take advantage of crispy forms, as shown in the following code:  

```python

   # forms.py
   from django import forms
   from . import models
   from crispy_forms.helper import FormHelper
   from crispy_forms.layout import Submit
   class ImportantDateForm(forms.ModelForm):
       class Meta:
           model = models.ImportantDate
           fields = ["date", "desc"]
       def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
           super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
           self.helper = FormHelper(self)
           self.helper.layout.append(Submit('save', 'Save'))

```
  
Thanks to crispy forms, we need very little HTML markup in our templates to build these CRUD forms.  

>􏰉Note that explicitly 􏰀entioning the fields of a ModelForm method is a best practice and will soon become mandatory in future releases.  

The template paths, by default, are based on the view class and the model names. For brevity, we omitted the template source here. Note that we can use the same form for CreateView and UpdateView.  

Finally, we take a look at urls.py, where everything is wired up together:  

```python
url(r'^impdates/create/$',
       pviews.ImpDateCreate.as_view(), name="impdate_create"),
   url(r'^impdates/(?P<pk>\d+)/$',
       pviews.ImpDateDetail.as_view(), name="impdate_detail"),
   url(r'^impdates/(?P<pk>\d+)/update/$',
       pviews.ImpDateUpdate.as_view(), name="impdate_update"),
   url(r'^impdates/(?P<pk>\d+)/delete/$',
       pviews.ImpDateDelete.as_view(), name="impdate_delete"),
```
  
Django generic views are a great way to get started with creating CRUD views for your models. With a few lines of code, you get well-tested model forms and views created for you, rather than doing the boring task yourself.  

##Summary
In this chapter, we looked at how web forms work and how they are abstracted using form classes in Django. We also looked at the various techniques and patterns to save time while working with forms.  

In the next chapter, we will take a look at a systematic approach to work with a legacy Django codebase, and how we can enhance it to meet evolving client needs.
